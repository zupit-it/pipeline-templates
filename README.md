# Zupit Reusable Workflows

This repository contains reusable workflows to check, build, and deploy our projects.

Here we list only the workflows to be referenced externally with some examples of how to implement them.
The reason why we skip some workflows is due to the fact that these are already included inside other workflows
in order to reduce boilerplate when writing the final workflows.
If you would like to get more details of these tasks, just look at this [doc](docs/GROUPED_STEP_WORKFLOWS.md).

## Composite Actions

Composite actions allow to group together a set of steps and use them inside other jobs' steps, reducing the duplicated code in the workflows.
Each composite action must be located in its own folder and the path to this folder will be the way to reference the action externally.

For example, the action of building a NodeJs project is located in the folder **.github/actions/node/build**.
If you need to use this action, you need to append to the repository name the path **.github/actions/node/build**:

`zupit-it/pipeline-templates/.github/actions/node/build`

### Actions - Naming convention

Each composite should be located inside the path

`zupit-it/pipeline-templates/.github/actions/<technology>/<action-to-execute>`

Where:

-   **technology** is the technology used to execute the action. For example, the build of a NodeJS project, **NodeJS** is the technology.
-   **action-to-execute** is the action that you want to execute. In the previous example, **build** is the action.

In this way, all actions for the same technology are grouped together.

Sometimes you could need more than one nesting level because you want to group multiple actions. The only case, as of now, is to group deploy actions by service and by provider.

For example:

-   Azure
    -   App Service
    -   Functions
    -   Storage Accounts
-   AWS
    -   App Runner
    -   Lambda
    -   S3 bucket

### NodeJS Action

#### NodeJS Action - Build

###### Requirements

This workflow requires this command in order to succeed:

1. **build:{environment}**: Build the project based on the target **environment** (e.g. _testing_, _staging_ and _production_)

_This workflow call automatically the action **checkout** to download the codebase._

This workflow uses **npm** as package manager.

###### Action

**.github/actions/node/build** is the action that builds a NodeJS project.

It requires these inputs:

-   **NODE_VERSION**: The NodeJS version required to build the project.
-   **RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT**: The environment for which the project must be compiled (e.g. _testing_, _staging_, _production_).
-   **WORKING_DIRECTORY**: The directory where the runner can execute all the commands.

In addition, it is possible to specify this optional input:

-   **SHELL**: The shell type to use. By default, it is **bash**.
-   **PROJECT**: The project to use when running npm scripts. If set, the executed npm script will be `{PROJECT}:{SCRIPT_NAME}` instead of `{SCRIPT_NAME}`.
-   **CHECKOUT_REF**: The ref of the branch/tag to check out before running the build. See the ref parameter of the [checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout). By default, it is `''`.
-   **RUN_ON**: the _label_ to select the correct _github-runner_ that will execute this workflow. Default is **zupit-agents**.
-   **RUNNERS_CONTAINER_GROUP**: The runners group used to execute this workflow. Default is **Container**.

This is an example to show how data should be formatted.

```yaml
jobs:
    build-and-push-image:
        uses: zupit-it/pipeline-templates/.github/workflows/node-step-docker-build-and-push-image.yml@v1.25.0
        with:
            NODE_VERSION: 16.17.0
            RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT: testing

### Docker Action

#### Docker Action - Build and Push Docker Image

###### Requirements

This workflow requires a **Dockerfile** inside the _working directory_ to create the docker image to publish on a docker registry.

_Before calling this workflow, remember to call the action **checkout** to download the codebase._

This workflow uses **npm** as package manager.

###### Action

**.github/actions/docker/build-and-push** is the composite action that builds the docker image and then push it to the registry.

It requires these inputs:

-   **WORKING_DIRECTORY**: The directory where the runner can execute all the commands.
-   **REGISTRY_URL**: The registry url where to push the Docker image. By default, it is **ghcr.io**.
-   **REGISTRY_USER**: The registry url where to push the Docker image.
    By default, it is the GitHub variable **github.actor**, the user who started the workflow.
-   **REGISTRY_PASSWORD**: The user's password to access the registry.
-   **DOCKERFILE_PATH**: The path to the Dockerfile to build.
-   **DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME**: The name to assign to the built Docker image.
-   **DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG**: The tag to assign to the built Docker image.
-   **BUILD_ARGS**: Additional data to pass when building the Dockerfile.
-   **ENV_VARIABLES**: A stringified json to pass multiple values at once, since Github does not propagate env variables.

It then outputs this variable:

-   **DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME**: The final Docker image name with the registry path included.

This is an example to show how data should be formatted.

```yaml
steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Build & Push Docker
      id: docker
      uses: zupit-it/pipeline-templates/.github/actions/docker/build-and-push@v1.25.0

The generated artifact name is in the format `prefix-<random-string>`.

###### Requirements

-   Bash

###### Action

**.github/actions/artifact/generate-name** is the action that generates a unique name for an artifact using the specified prefix. This is useful when you have multiple artifacts to upload on the same workflow, and you want to avoid name collisions.

It requires these inputs:

-   **NAME_PREFIX**: The prefix to use when generating the artifact name.

It then outputs this variable:

-   **ARTIFACT_NAME**: The generated artifact name.

This is an example to show how to use this action with the support of the **Generate artifact name** action.

          ARCHIVE_PATH: /tmp/my-archive.tar.gz
          OUTPUT_FOLDER: my-output-folder
```

## Reusable Workflows

In all the examples, we set _secrets: inherit_ to pass all secrets to the reusable workflows, but it is also possible to pass only a subset of secrets.

In addition, we added for all _step_ workflows the input _LABELS_ as GitHub does not allow to set the _runs-on_ from the caller side, but only inside
the reusable workflows. As we want to define the runners as late as possible, we decided to add this input variable.

### Naming convention

We've defined 2 different types of workflows:

-   **step**: a _reusable workflow_ that _runs a set of specific tasks_ that can be grouped together
    (e.g. checking if the project is linted and builds, run the tests, build and push a docker image, ...).
-   **workflow**: a _reusable workflow_ that _contains a set of our "steps" workflows_ to reduce the boilerplate when writing the final workflows.
    One of the use cases is to check if the code is linted, it builds correctly and the tests pass, as this is used in almost all of our projects.

Our reusable workflows are named to follow this standard:

`<technology-or-application>-<workflow-type>-<action-to-execute>.yml`

Thus, it is easy to understand that the workflows uses a specific technology or application to execute the desired action.

### NodeJS - Backend & Frontend

> The following workflows are deprecated:
>
> -   node-step-docker-build-and-push-image.yml
> -   node-step-format-lint-build.yml
> -   node-workflow-common.yml

#### NodeJS Common

###### Requirements

This workflow requires these commands in order to succeed:

1. **[PROJECT:]ci:format:check**: Check that the code is formatted correctly.
2. **[PROJECT:]ci:lint**: Check that the code is linted correctly.
3. **[PROJECT:]ci:build**: Check that the project builds correctly
4. **[PROJECT:]ci:e2e**: Check that all cypress tests pass _(only if tests are enabled)_.
   This command must generate the coverage report **lcov.info** inside the **coverage** folder in the NodeJS directory.
   (e.g. `frontend/coverage/lcov.info`)

The **optional** `PROJECT` value is used in configurations where a single Node solution hosts multiple projects. This is the case for NX, where multiple applications and libraries exist in the same Node project.

This workflow uses **npm** as package manager.

###### Workflow

**node-workflow-common.yml** is the reusable workflow to check that the code is correctly formatted and linted, that it
builds correctly and that all tests pass.

It groups together these reusable workflows:

-   _node-step-format-lint-build.yml_
-   _node-step-test-cypress.yml_

It requires these inputs:

-   **WORKING_DIRECTORY**: The directory where the runner can execute all the commands. This is basically the directory which contains the NodeJS application.
-   **NODE_VERSION**: The NodeJS Docker image where the runner execute all the commands.
-   **CYPRESS_IMAGE**: The Cypress Docker image where the runner execute all the commands.
-   **DIST_PATH**: The output distribution path of the node build

In addition, it is possible to specify these optional inputs:

-   **COVERAGE_ARTIFACT_NAME**: The artifact's name for the _lcov.info_ file. By default, it is **lcov.info**.
-   **ENABLE_TESTS**: Whether it should skip or not the cypress tests workflow. By default, it is **true**.
-   **TIMEOUT**: Used for tests, if the tests take more than the given time in minutes, Github stops forcefully the workflow. By default, it is **30**.
-   **RUN**: Whether to run all the jobs inside workflows or not. This is useful when you want to skip checks since the code didn't change. By default, it is **true**.
-   **PROJECT**: The project to use when running npm scripts. If set, the executed npm script will be `{PROJECT}:{SCRIPT_NAME}` instead of `{SCRIPT_NAME}`.
-   **RUN_ON**: the _label_ to select the correct _github-runner_ that will execute this workflow. Default is **zupit-agents**.
-   **RUNNERS_CONTAINER_GROUP**: The runners group used to execute this workflow. Default is **Container**.

This is an example to show how data should be formatted.

```yaml
jobs:
    node-common:
        uses: zupit-it/pipeline-templates/.github/workflows/node-workflow-common.yml@v1.25.0
        with:
            WORKING_DIRECTORY: frontend
            NODE_VERSION: 16.17.0
            CYPRESS_IMAGE: cypress/browsers:node16.17.0-chrome106
        secrets: inherit
```

##### Run Optimization

This workflow allows to skip the inner jobs using the input variable **RUN**.
This is useful when the code didn't change, and you want to skip the required checks and allow the PR to move on.
One way to check whether the code changed or not is by using the **dorny/paths-filter@v2** action.
Here is an example of how to know if the code changed and based from that, run or not the workflows.

```yaml
jobs:
    check-changes:
        runs-on: [pinga, pipeline, container]

        outputs:
            backend: ${{ steps.changes.outputs.backend }}
            frontend: ${{ steps.changes.outputs.frontend }}

        steps:
            - uses: dorny/paths-filter@v2
              id: changes
              with:
                  filters: |
                      backend:
                        - 'backend/**'
                      frontend:
                        - 'frontend/**'

    angular-common:
        needs: check-changes
        uses: zupit-it/pipeline-templates/.github/workflows/node-workflow-common.yml@v1.25.0
        with:
            WORKING_DIRECTORY: "frontend"
            NODE_VERSION: "14.11.0"
            ENABLE_TESTS: false
            RUN: ${{ needs.check-changes.outputs.frontend == 'true' }}
        secrets: inherit
```

This basically checks if the 2 folders: **backend** and **frontend**, were touched or not.
If there are any change in the **frontend** folder, then execute all inner workflows inside **node-workflow-common**.

#### NodeJS build docker image and push to registry

###### Requirements

This workflow requires this command in order to succeed:

1. **build:{environment}**: Build the project based on the target **environment** (e.g. _testing_, _staging_ and _production_)

It also requires a **Dockerfile** inside the _working directory_ to create the docker image to publish on a docker registry.

This workflow uses **npm** as package manager.

###### Workflow

**node-step-docker-build-and-push-image.yml** is the workflow that builds the docker image and then push it to the registry.
This is a similar version of the _docker-step-build-and-push-image.yml_ as this adds the NodeJS build of the project.

This workflow uses these composite actions:

-   **actions/node/build**: builds NodeJS project
-   **actions/docker/build-and-push**: creates the Docker image and pushes it to the desired registry.

_This workflow uses a NodeJS Docker image, hence remember to use labels to match runners specific for Docker._

It requires these inputs:

-   **NODE_VERSION**: The NodeJS version required to build the project.
-   **WORKING_DIRECTORY**: The directory where the runner can execute all the commands.
-   **RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT**: The environment for which the project must be compiled (e.g. _testing_, _staging_, _production_).
-   **DOCKERFILE_PATH**: The path to the Dockerfile to build.
-   **DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME**: The name to assign to the built Docker image.
-   **DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG**: The tag to assign to the built Docker image.
-   **BUILD_ARGS**: Additional data to pass when building the Dockerfile.
-   **DIST_PATH**: The output distribution path of the node build
-   **ARTIFACT_NAME**: The name of the artifact. Should be changed when using multiple node builds for the same project at the same time

In addition, it is possible to specify these optional inputs:

-   **RUN_ON**: the _label_ to select the correct _github-runner_ that will execute this workflow. Default is **zupit-agents**.
-   **RUNNERS_CONTAINER_GROUP**: The runners group used to execute this workflow. Default is **Container**.
-   **REGISTRY_URL**: The registry url where to push the Docker image. By default, it is **ghcr.io**.
-   **REGISTRY_USER**: The registry url where to push the Docker image.
    By default, it is the GitHub variable **github.actor**, the user who started the workflow. If you need a different user, remember to override the **GITHUB_TOKEN** secret.
-   **PROJECT**: The project to use when running npm scripts. If set, the executed npm script will be `{PROJECT}:{SCRIPT_NAME}` instead of `{SCRIPT_NAME}`.
-   **CHECKOUT_REF**: The ref of the branch/tag to check out before running the build. See the ref parameter of the [checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout). By default, it is `''`.

It then outputs this variable:

-   **DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME**: The final Docker image name with the registry path included.

This is an example to show how data should be formatted.

```yaml
jobs:
    build-and-push-image:
        uses: zupit-it/pipeline-templates/.github/workflows/node-step-docker-build-and-push-image.yml@v1.25.0
        with:
            NODE_VERSION: 16.17.0
            RELEASE_ENVIRONMENT: testing
            WORKING_DIRECTORY: frontend
            REGISTRY_URL: ghcr.io
            DOCKERFILE_PATH: frontend/docker/Dockerfile
            DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME: ionic
            DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG: latest
            BUILD_ARGS: |
                DIST_PATH=dist/apps/enci
        secrets: inherit
```

#### NodeJS build and deploy to Azure Storage

This workflow combines two main actions:

-   [Node.js Build](#nodejs-action---build)
-   [Azure Storage Account](#azure-action---storage-account---deploy)

The input parameters of this workflow have the same name of the corresponding parameters in child actions. Refer to them for more information.

Also, these input parameters are optional:

-   **IMAGE**: the docker image to use when running the node build. By default, it is **ubuntu:23.04**.
-   **AZURE_CLI_IMAGE**: the docker image to use when running the deployment to Azure Storage. By default, it is **mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli:2.50.0**.
-   **RUN_ON**: the _label_ to select the correct _github-runner_ that will execute this workflow. Default is **zupit-agents**.
-   **RUNNERS_CONTAINER_GROUP**: The runners group used to execute this workflow. Default is **Container**.

This is an example to show how data should be formatted.

```yaml
jobs:

        uses: zupit-it/pipeline-templates/.github/workflows/springboot-workflow-common.yml@v1.25.0
        with:
            CONTAINER_CI_LABELS: "['pinga', 'pipeline', 'container']"
            WORKING_DIRECTORY: backend
            JAVA_IMAGE: openjdk:12
            USE_CI_POSTGRES: false
            RUN: ${{ needs.check-changes.outputs.backend == 'true' }}
        secrets: inherit
```

This basically checks if the 2 folders: **backend** and **frontend**, were touched or not.
If there are any change in the **backend** folder, then execute all inner workflows inside **django-workflow-common**.

        SONAR_IMAGE: "ghcr.io/zupit-it/pipeline-templates/flutter-sonar-scanner-cli:latest"
    secrets: inherit
```

#### Sonar Analyze - .NET

###### Requirements

This workflow DOES NOT use the **sonar-project.properties** as the [Sonar Analyze](#sonar-analyze) workflow does. See the [documentation](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/how-to-specify-sonar-project-properties-file-in-dotnet-scanner-command/31805/3).

Additional properties are provided by this workflow and the required ones are exposed as required inputs.

###### Workflow

**sonar-step-dotnet-analyze.yml** is the workflow that analyze a .NET solution, including the coverage, and sends the results to Sonarqube.

**IMPORTANT:** since this step relies on bash scripting, the _CONTAINER_CI_LABELS_ you provide must reference a container with bash already installed.

You can't use a `sonar-project.properties` file since it's [not supported](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/configure-net-core-analysis-with-configuration-file/41299/2) from SonarScanner for .NET.
-   **COVERAGE_EXCLUSIONS**: A comma separated list of glob patterns to match files and/or folders that should be excluded when computing tests code coverage ([docs](https://github.com/coverlet-coverage/coverlet/blob/master/Documentation/MSBuildIntegration.md#source-files)). Since `dotnet test` expect absolute path for the exclusion list, you should provide this parameter in the form `**/my-path/*.cs` (always starting with `**/*`).
-   **DOTNET_VERSION**: The .NET version to build the solution. By default, it is `7`.
-   **RUN_ON**: the _label_ to select the correct _github-runner_ that will execute this workflow. Default is **zupit-agents**.

#### Concurrent Workflow Runs

Use the concurrency feature to manage overlapping workflow runs, ensuring only the most recent commit in branches like main triggers a workflow.
This optimizes resource usage and keeps deployments current.

##### Main Workflow Example with Concurrency

```yaml
on:
    push:
        branches: ["main", "release/*"]

concurrency:
    group: ${{ github.ref }}
    cancel-in-progress: true

jobs: ...
```

_Note:_ When using concurrency with workflows that trigger others, ensure subsequent workflows account for potential cancellations of initiating workflows.
This may involve status checks or logic adjustments for such cases.
