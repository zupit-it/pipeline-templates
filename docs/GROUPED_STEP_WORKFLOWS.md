## Reusable Workflows

### NodeJS

#### NodeJS Lint & Build

###### Requirements

This workflow requires these commands in order to succeed:

1. **ci:format:check**: Check that the code is formatted correctly.
2. **ci:lint**: Check that the code is linted correctly.
3. **ci:build**: Check that the project builds correctly

This workflow uses **npm** as package manager.

###### Workflow

**node-step-format-lint-build.yml** is the reusable workflow to check if the code is linted correctly and that it
builds correctly.

It requires these inputs:

- **LABELS**: the _labels_ to select the correct _github-runner_ that will execute this workflow. The format is a stringified JSON list of labels.
- **WORKING_DIRECTORY**: The directory where the runner can execute all the commands. This is basically the directory which contains the NodeJS application.
- **NODE_VERSION**: The NodeJS version required to execute all the commands

In addition, it is possible to specify this optional input:

- RUN: Whether to run all the workflow or not. This is useful when you want to skip the workflow since the code didn't change. By default, it is **true**.

This is an example to show how data should be formatted.

```yaml
jobs:
    node-lint-check-build:
        uses: zupit-it/pipeline-templates/.github/workflows/node-step-format-lint-build.yml@v1.22.4
        with:
            WORKING_DIRECTORY: frontend
            NODE_VERSION: 14.11.0
        secrets: inherit
```

#### NodeJS Run Cypress Tests

###### Requirements

This workflow requires this command in order to succeed:

1. **ci:e2e**: Check that all cypress tests pass _(only if tests are enabled)_.
   This command must generate the coverage report **lcov.info** inside the **coverage** folder in the NodeJS directory.
   (e.g. `frontend/coverage/lcov.info`)

This workflow uses **npm** as package manager.

###### Workflow

**node-step-test-cypress.yml** is the reusable workflow to run and check that all cypress tests pass.
If all tests pass, it then generates the coverage and save it as artifact so that it is available for tools like Sonarqube.

_This workflow uses a cypress docker image, hence remember to use labels to match runners specific for docker._

It requires these inputs:

- **LABELS**: the _labels_ to select the correct _github-runner_ that will execute this workflow. The format is a stringified JSON list of labels.
- **WORKING_DIRECTORY**: The directory where the runner can execute all the commands. This is basically the directory which contains the NodeJS application.
- **CYPRESS_IMAGE**: The Cypress Docker image to run all tests.
- **COVERAGE_ARTIFACT_NAME**: The artifact's name for the _lcov.info_ file.

In addition, it is possible to specify this optional input:

- BROWSER: Which browser the cypress should use to run the tests. By default, it is **Chrome**.
- TIMEOUT: If the tests take more than the given time in minutes, Github stops forcefully the workflow. By default, it is **30**.
- RUN: Whether to run all the workflow or not. This is useful when you want to skip the workflow since the code didn't change. By default, it is **true**.

This is an example to show how data should be formatted.

```yaml
jobs:
    cypress-run:
        uses: zupit-it/pipeline-templates/.github/workflows/node-step-test-cypress.yml@v1.0.2
        with:
            LABELS: "['pinga', 'pipeline', 'container']"
            WORKING_DIRECTORY: frontend
            CYPRESS_IMAGE: cypress/browsers:node16.17.0-chrome106
            COVERAGE_ARTIFACT_NAME: lcov.info
        secrets: inherit
```

In addition, it is possible to specify this optional input:

- RUN: Whether to run all the workflow or not. This is useful when you want to skip the workflow since the code didn't change. By default, it is **true**.

This is an example to show how data should be formatted.

```yaml
jobs:
    django-lint-check:
        uses: zupit-it/pipeline-templates/.github/workflows/django-step-lint-check.yml@v1.0.2
